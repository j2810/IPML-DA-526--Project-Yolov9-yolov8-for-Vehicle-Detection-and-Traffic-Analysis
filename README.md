# IPML-DA-526--Project-Yolov9-yolov8-for-Vehicle-Detection-and-Traffic-Analysis
This Project is to develop an efficient and accurate vehicle detection and traffic analysis system using YOLOv9 and YOLOv8. This system will enable real-time vehicle detection in traffic scenarios, providing insights such as vehicle counts, traffic flow analysis, and congestion monitoring.

## Use Cases
Traffic Flow Analysis: Use the "Car Counting" model to investigate traffic congestion on highways, identify peak travel hours, or optimize traffic light timings.

Transportation Planning: Use it to assess potential road upgrades/expansions by counting the number of specific vehicle types over time.

Parking Management: Employ it in counting and monitoring available spaces in a lot by identifying and subtracting currently occupied spots (depending on vehicle size/type).

Security and Law Enforcement: Use the model to identify unusual or suspicious activity by tracking the frequency and type of vehicles in particular areas at various times.

Retail Studies: Use it to analyze customer visits in a store parking lot by identifying and counting the types of vehicles at different intervals, potentially understanding the store's peak hours or client habits.
